This interest in the underlying psychology of human behavior returns economics to its earliest roots. Scholars such as Adam Smith talked about such key concepts as loss aversion, overconfidence and self-control. Nevertheless, the modern version of behavioral economics introduced in the 1980s met with resistance by some economists, who preferred to retain the standard neo-classical model. They introduced several arguments for why psychology could safely be ignored. Thaler will show that these arguments have been rejected, both theoretically and empirically, so it is time to move on.

The Future of the Internet: Governance & ConflictThis year marks a milestone in the internet’s history as the governance of its protocols transitions from a U.S.-controlled institution to an international body. How will the internet be governed moving forward, and how will that affect individual freedoms across the globe? How will nations deter cyber attacks on their systems, and what’s at stake if they don\'t? Cybersecurity experts will meet to talk about what the future holds and what governments can do to better defend against cyber threats.Learn more: http://www.cmu.edu/carnegie-colloquium/",   "location": "Rangos Ballroom, Cohon University Center ",   "creator": {    "email": "bg02@andrew.cmu.edu"   },   "organizer": {    "email": "andrew.cmu.edu_333234353933332d373938@resource.calendar.google.com",    "displayName": "Event Calendar",    "self": true   },   "start": {    "dateTime": "2016-12-02T09:00:00-05:00"   },   "end": {    "dateTime": "2016-12-02T13:45:00-05:00"   },   "iCalUID": "rh2hik5teqd88f6ipvl7h4hego@google.com",   "sequence": 0,   "hangoutLink": "https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/andrew.cmu.edu/andrew-cmu-edu?hceid=YW5kcmV3LmNtdS5lZHVfMzMzMjM0MzUzOTMzMzMyZDM3MzkzOEByZXNvdXJjZS5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t.rh2hik5teqd88f6ipvl7h4hego",   "reminders": {    "useDefault": true   }  },  {   "kind": "calendar#event",   "etag": "2958310071504000",   "id": "l5vn4eokfef77fq8j8u7hns1t0",   "status": "confirmed",   "htmlLink": "https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bDV2bjRlb2tmZWY3N2ZxOGo4dTdobnMxdDAgYW5kcmV3LmNtdS5lZHVfMzMzMjM0MzUzOTMzMzMyZDM3MzkzOEByZXNvdXJjZS5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t",   "created": "2016-11-14T20:23:34.000Z",   "updated": "2016-11-14T20:23:55.752Z",   "summary": "Holiday Sale",   "description": "Join us for our annual holiday sale, with special discounts on your favorite items.

This interest in the underlying psychology of human behavior returns economics to its earliest roots. Scholars such as Adam Smith talked about such key concepts as loss aversion, overconfidence and self-control. Nevertheless, the modern version of behavioral economics introduced in the 1980s met with resistance by some economists, who preferred to retain the standard neo-classical model. They introduced several arguments for why psychology could safely be ignored. Thaler will show that these arguments have been rejected, both theoretically and empirically, so it is time to move on.
